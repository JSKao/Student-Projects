# Atom-light interaction
Ab-initio calculation for the dynamics of hydrogen atom in strong laser field is given by the code [`gpsnew.f90`](https://github.com/JSKao/Atomic-calculation/blob/master/gpsnew.f90).

Density functional theory treatment of the same problem is given by the code [`dft.f90`](https://github.com/JSKao/Atomic-calculation/blob/master/dft.f90)

Those are to reproduce the work in this [`paper`](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301010497000633?via%3Dihub)
